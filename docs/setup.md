```shell
docker run -d --name torrent-stream-server ghcr.io/kiralt/torrent-stream-server:latest
```

### Custom port

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

```shell
docker run -d --name torrent-stream-server -p 80:3000 ghcr.io/kiralt/torrent-stream-server:latest
```

You'll be able to access it on http://localhost

### Using Docker Compose
You can also use the provided [Docker Compose manifest](../docker-compose.yml). Customize as needed by editing and run:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
Also, you can use the provided manifest as a reference for Docker deployment.
