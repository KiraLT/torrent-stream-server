## From Source

> Frontend & backend are separate packages.

So during development you will need to run two dev servers with live reload:

* `npm run dev` - starts both backend and frontend development servers
* `npm run dev-backend` - start dev server on `3000` port
* `npm run dev-frontend` - start dev server on  `3001` port

## Commands

* `npm install` - will install both: `frontend` & `backend`
* `npm run build` - will build backend to `lib` directory & frontend to `frontend/build`
* `npm run start` - start HTTP server with frontend support
* `npm run dev-backend` - start `backend` server with live reload on `3000` port
* `npm run dev-frontend` - start `frontend` server with live reload on `3001` port
